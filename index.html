<h2> What are Cephalopods? </h2>
<i>A cephalopod is any member of the molluscan class Cephalopoda. These exclusively marine animals are characterized by bilateral body symmetry, a prominent head, and a set of arms or tentacles modified from the primitive molluscan foot. Fishers sometimes call cephalopods "inkfish", referring to their common ability to squirt ink. The 4 main families of the species are:</i>
<ul>
<li> Octopuses, </li>
<li> Squids,</li>
<li> Cuttlefish,</li>
<li> and Nautilus.
</li>
</ul>

<a name="what makes them different"></a>
<h2> What makes them different? </h2>
<i> Although they're all unique and have their differences, all cephalopods have certain distinct characteristics in common. </i>
<ol>
<li><u> They have three hearts and blue blood </u></li>
<li><u> They are able to change colours rapidly and at their own will </u></li>
<li><u> They all share the same basic anatomy: composed of a body, head and foot. They have at least eight arms, which have either suckers or hooks on their undersides. </u></li>
<li><u> They are all carnivores, eating a variety of fish, crustaceans and mollusks. </u></li>
</ol>

<h2>Octopuses</h2>
<p> Octopuses are sea animals famous for their rounded bodies, bulging eyes, and eight long arms. They live in all the world’s oceans but are especially abundant in warm, tropical waters. Octopuses, like their cousin, the squid, are often considered “monsters of the deep,” though some species, or types, occupy relatively shallow waters. There are over 300 species of octopuses. </p>
<img src =
"https://www.animalspot.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Types-of-Octopus.jpg">
<p> Octopuses have a complex nervous system and excellent sight, and are among the most intelligent and behaviourally diverse of all invertebrates.
    Strategies to defend themselves against predators include the expulsion of ink, the use of camouflage and threat displays, the ability to jet quickly through the water and hide, and even deceit. All octopuses are venomous, but only the blue-ringed octopuses are known to be deadly to humans. </p>

    <h2>Squids</h2>
    <p> Squid are cephalopods in the superorder Decapodiformes with elongated bodies, large eyes, eight arms and two tentacles. Like all other cephalopods, squid have a distinct head, bilateral symmetry, and a mantle. They are mainly soft-bodied, like octopuses, but have a small internal skeleton in the form of a rod-like gladius or pen, made of chitin. There are around 300 species of squid in the world. </p>
    <img src =
    "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f2/0a/55/f20a55476ddf6b349fbcfccb40720395.jpg">
    <p> The giant squid is massive and when full grown can be at least 10 meters long. These mysterious eight-armed creatures are rarely seen by humans. Most of what we know about them comes from finding them washed up on beaches. The biggest giant-squid ever recorded was around 13-18 meters.
        The species, along with its familiar, the colossal squid, have beach-ball size eyes. They have the largest eyes in the animal kingdom and are about 25 centimeters in diameter. This helps them to identify objects in dark depths. </p>

        <h2>Cuttlefish</h2>
        Despite their name, cuttlefish are not fish but intelligent invertebrates related to the octopus, squid, and nautilus. These fascinating creatures can count, exert self-control, and have numerous wily tactics to evade predators, including creating their own body double from a cloud of ink. There are around 120 species of cuttlefish in the world. </p>
        <img src =
        "https://rangerrick.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Photo-of-Cuttlefish-by-Brandon-Cole-1156x650-1.jpg">
        <p> Although being colorblind, cuttlefish also have highly sophisticated color-changing abilities. Theyare usually solitary animals and can be found in oceans all around the world. While most live in shallow waters, some species can be found at depths of more than 914 meters.
            Cuttlefish control buoyancy using an internal shell called the cuttlebone. By adding different amounts of liquid or gas into tiny holes within this structure, these animals can change their buoyancy, making them float up or down. They can also move using jet propulsion: filling their body cavities with water then forcefully squirting it out to propel themselves backward. </p>

            <a name="nautilus"></a>
            <h2>Nautilus</h2>
            Nautiluses are a living link to the ancient past. They've been around over 480 million years, cruising deep ocean reefs even before the time of dinosaurs. These soft-bodied creatures live inside an intricately chambered shell. Although their taxonomy is poorly resolved, the nautilus family, Nautilidae, is currently considered to include seven species in two genera, Nautilus and Allonautilus, all which share the common name, chambered nautilus. </p>
            <img src =
            "https://img.bestdealplus.com/ae04/kf/Hfeaef1db5d2c4aea811c66b53a7c213bt.jpg">
            <p> A nautilus can only sense dark and light with its simple, pinhole-type eyes. But a nautilus can perceive water depth and current directions, as well as current speeds, to help it keep its body upright. A highly developed sense of smell helps a nautilus search for food and find mates..
                A native of the tropical Pacific, the nautilus is an octopus cousin. It has more than 90 tentacles — the most of any cephalopod — which it uses to feel and grope along the reefs for food. Unlike those of other cephalopods, a nautilus's tentacles have grooves and ridges instead of suckers. These grooves and ridges are coated with a sticky secretion that help the nautilus grip food and pass it to its mouth. A nautilus uses its sharp, beaklike mouth to break food apart, and its radula (a band of tissue lined with tiny teeth) to further shred its food. </p>
